The project involves the development of a console application that will be used for the logistics service of the seaport in terms of a cargo terminal for transport vessels adapted for the transportation of containers. 
The application will be used for unloading and loading containers from/onto the ship. In the case of
unloading, the containers can go to a warehouse or directly to a transport wagon.
